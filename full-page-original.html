    	<h3>Shared Governance</h3>
<p>Shared Governance at ArtCenter is a structured process wherein key stakeholders conduct inquiry, administer research and make recommendations based on collective conversation to support effective decision-making. The College recognizes that the President and designees, and the Board of Trustees, are ultimately responsible for making the final decisions on significant matters as an essential aspect of their respective duties. Shared governance is a vital part of the advisory process that informs those decisions.</p>
<h3><br />Representational Committees</h3>
<h4><b>Faculty Council</b></h4>
<p>Art Center Faculty Council (ACFC) is the official advocacy body of the faculty. The purpose of ACFC is to represent the concerns of faculty within the shared governance structure of the College. The Council makes policy recommendations relevant to educational and faculty issues, and representatives serve on all of the College's shared governance committees.</p>
<h4><b>Chairs Council</b></h4>
<p>The Chairs Council is ArtCenter's educational leadership committee. It is comprised of the chairs of all Undergraduate and Graduate departments, the Vice President of Designmatters, and the Managing Director of Public Programs. The Chairs Council reports to the Provost, who also attends all Chairs Council meetings.</p>
<h4><b>Staff Council</b></h4>
<p>Staff Council (SC) acts as an advocacy body for the entire ArtCenter staff, providing recommendations directly to the President on issues and policies affecting staff in general. SC serves as a vehicle to empower staff, raise awareness and help facilitate resolution for policy and culture issues that affect staff as a whole. Efforts are made to ensure representation from all administrative departments but membership is strictly voluntary.</p>
<h4><b>Student Government (ACSG)</b></h4>
<p>The mission of ArtCenter Student Government (ACSG) is to support healthy, successful students, engage in leadership for College governance and foster a thriving community. ACSG strives to serve these purposes by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhancing the ArtCenter student experience in representation of student needs, interests and concerns, and advocating for student perspective;</li>
<li>Providing opportunities for leadership at ArtCenter in transparent, accountable and change-oriented ways;</li>
<li>Offering ongoing critical analysis of ArtCenter policies, practice and culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>ACSG is dedicated to improving all aspects of the student experience at ArtCenter. As elected representatives of the student body, ACSG members serve on collegewide committees as liaisons to the administration, communicate policy changes to the student body, act as the student voice, plan programs and facilitate communication between academic departments. ACSG includes an executive board, representatives from all departments, and the Student Activities Board, which sponsors some traditional campus programs.</p>
<h3><br />Collegewide Committees</h3>
<h4><b>Budget Committee</b></h4>
<p>The mission of the Budget Committee is to recommend a budget that adheres to the mission of the College and the strategic objectives of the President and Board of Trustees. ArtCenter&rsquo;s Budget Committee is a standing body comprised of representatives from the College&rsquo;s students, staff, department chairs and faculty. The Budget Committee serves the office of the President and, through that office, the Board of Trustees and its committees.</p>
<h4><b>College Facilities Committee</b></h4>
<p>Facilities, both educational and institutional, are a manifestation of how ArtCenter engages in its educational mission. The College Facilities Committee (CFC) is a standing committee chartered to review and propose facility improvements in support of ArtCenter&rsquo;s strategic plan and educational mission. CFC has the responsibility not only to guide the planning and programming of new facilities but also to maintain and improve existing programming and infrastructures.</p>
<p>The committee acts as a conduit for information regarding these issues providing research and recommendations to and from other decision-making bodies, including the President, Provost, Executive Staff, Chairs Council, Faculty Council, Staff Council, ACSG, EcoCouncil and other members of shared governance. It is the responsibility of the CFC Committee to foster the evolution of ArtCenter as one college with a distributed campus, both real and virtual.</p>
<h4><b>Technology Committee</b></h4>
<p>The mission of the Technology Committee is to consider and evaluate current and emerging uses of technologies and to provide advice and support for excellent user-centered technology strategies and plans in alignment with the College&rsquo;s mission and strategic objectives.</p>
<p>The Technology Committee (TC) at ArtCenter is a shared governance committee comprised of representatives from the College&rsquo;s students, staff, department chairs, and faculty. The TC serves the office of the President, and through that office, the Board of Trustees and its committees. The TC is the primary avenue for recommendations about policies, procedures and planning related to technology use across all campuses.</p>
<p>The committee defines technology as instructional and administrative tools, which includes the use of computers; hand-held mobile devices; A/V; various media; the Internet; technology-enhanced spaces such as classrooms, shops, labs, and studios; digital services such as software, platforms, file storage and networks.</p>
<h4><b>The Council for Diversity and Inclusion</b></h4>
<p>Parallel to the institution&rsquo;s Budget, Facilities and Technology Committees, the Council for Diversity and Inclusion is a standing governance committee of the College, with a direct relationship to the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees. The Council&rsquo;s scope and structure is based in part on those of the Association of American Colleges and Universities.</p>
<p>ArtCenter views diversity of human enterprise, experience and identity as essential elements of great learning. Just as biodiversity contributes to healthy ecosystems, a diverse learning environment at ArtCenter features a wide range of thought, academic disciplines, cultures, identities and socio-economic backgrounds, supporting the creation of a robust community.<br /><br />A diverse college community that encourages interdisciplinary dialogue produces the sophisticated thinkers, practitioners and citizens needed today. In support of this, we are committed to building capacity for diversity and inclusion for all students, faculty, staff and trustees.</p>
<h4><b>Research Committee</b></h4>
<p>Grounded in the three pillars of ArtCenter&rsquo;s strategic plan&mdash;The Conservatory Spirit, Convening Diverse Communities, and New Spaces for Learning&mdash;research as a path to innovation and creativity is fundamental to the goals of the College. Research is essential to the conservatory spirit where &ldquo;each new studio requires independent or team-based research and analysis to understand context, address key issues and encourage innovation.&rdquo; Research fosters critical thought, the foundation of diversity of perspective, and finally, research offers essential methodologies for understanding and structuring new spaces for learning. The Research Committee provides a specific site through which ArtCenter can work to better understand the role of research in the life of the College, while also providing advocacy for the specific structures and policies that ongoing research demands.</p>
<p><b>Scope of Responsibilities:</b></p>
<p>The Research Committee will set specific goals based on the strategic plan, establish metrics of measurement to monitor and report strategic progress with respect to research College-wide, may make recommendations for educational and operational domains, make policy recommendations where need has been identified, research best practices and established models from peer institutions, participate in appropriate research networks and organizations, and build research infrastructure and culture at the College.</p>
<h3><br />Policy Recommendation Committees</h3>
<h4><b>Faculty Status and Policy Committee</b></h4>
<p>ArtCenter&rsquo;s Faculty Status and Policy Committee is chartered to review and propose changes to faculty status guidelines and policies, which includes but is not limited to, the Faculty Handbook, full- and part-time status, faculty letters of appointment, compensation, rank and grievance.</p>
<p>The committee is a recommending body made up of representatives of the Faculty Council, the Chairs Council, Academic Affairs and other staff (HR and Finance) and/or faculty at large as necessary for specific issues.</p>
<p>The Provost and President have final approval of all policies.</p>
<h4><b>Student Academic Policy Committee</b></h4>
<p>ArtCenter&rsquo;s Student Academic Policy Committee is chartered to review and propose changes to academic policy, which includes but is not limited to, student, enrollment, pedagogical and curricular issues.</p>
<p>The committee is a recommending body made up of representatives of the Faculty Council, the Chairs Council, ArtCenter Student Government, Academic Affairs, Student Affairs, Enrolment Services, Financial Aid, Finance and other staff and/or faculty as necessary for specific issues.</p>
<p>The Provost has final approval of all policies.</p>
<h3><br />Leadership Group</h3>
<h4><b>Shared Governance Leadership Group</b></h4>
<p>To give further shape and coherence to the understanding and practice of shared governance at ArtCenter, the President convenes the leaders of ArtCenter's individual shared governance groups each term to discuss collegewide initiatives and measure progress against the strategic plan.</p>    </div>
